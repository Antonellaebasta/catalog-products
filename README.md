This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

To achieve the goal of the task, I have created 3 main Components: Catalog, Product and Filter.
The Filter Component is for adding the filterByBrand functionality. For this Component I've written also I unit test with Jest and Enzyme.<br>
The multiColumns responsive layout is realized with CSS Grid Layout and a fallback in flexbox for non-supporting-grid browsers.<br>
For the Components styles, I've decided to use StyledComponents and ThemeProvider, because I think it's very scalable and maintainable.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
